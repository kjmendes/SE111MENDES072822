                <b>Kyesha Mendes</b> <i>August 11, 2022</i>
                <p>Minions the rise of gru, a cinematic masterpiece, a movie full of goofs, gaffs, and most definitely laughs, really made me feel special inside.
                     The film gave me hope, hope that society isn’t truly failed. The way that Bob, Kevin, and Stuart bonded together throughout the film was truly breathtaking, 
                     the way that they showed their appreciation for gru really made me reflect on the world today. How come, I, an Avid minions fan could never feel that much of a 
                     connection with another human however gru can have that powerful of a bond with minions who don’t speak his language is extremely empowering. The movie shows how us 
                     as a society can overlook our differences to show love for one another the type of love that makes you tingly inside and makes you want to do some spicy things. 

                    The plot twist at the end really was incredible, I mean truly, to not spoil it, the scene honestly had me shed a tear, it was a masterpiece every moment something powerful 
                    was happening it’s a truly underrated film and puts other movies to shame. To say that it is the best animated movie ever would be an understatement, honestly I believe this 
                    is the best film ever, never had I seen an auditorium full of such nicely dressed individuals cheer loud and proud at a film. I can’t express enough how amazed I was from start
                     to finish and I truly from the bottom of my heart thank everyone with involvement in the making of the film, the work you did to create such a classic will forever be admired, this film will be cherished by my family for generations to come as it will be the first movie I show my kids, the first movie 
                    I show my kids kids this film will live forever as it should and I really hope to see more from Gru and his silly little minions.</p>
